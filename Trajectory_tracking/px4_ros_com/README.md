# PX4-ROS2 bridge

This package is modified from original px4_ros_com package.
https://github.com/PX4/px4_ros_com.git

File offboard_control.cpp under src/offboard is modified for trajectory tracking on a drone.

This package provides example nodes for exchanging data and commands between ROS2 and PX4.
It also provides a [library](./include/px4_ros_com/frame_transforms.h) to ease the conversion between ROS2 and PX4 frame conventions.
It has a straight dependency on the [`px4_msgs`](https://github.com/PX4/px4_msgs) package.
